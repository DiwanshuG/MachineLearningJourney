# challenges in ML

## Data Collection

1) fetch data from API 
[challenges]


2) web scrapping 


## insufficient Data/Labelled Data

model A : 100 rows data
model B : 10^6 rows data 

models A & B are trained from different algorithms : but model B perform better 

<!-- when you have huge amount of data then it does not matter that much which algorithm you are using  -->
it's called unreleasnable effectiveness of data


[flicker:] a website from where you can find the images


## Non Representative Data

data aapka aadhi kahani bol rha hai : aadhi kahaani sun krke aap model ko bna de rhe hai but actual story is totally different 

[data gathering is very important] ::

sampling noise
sampling bias



## Poor quality Data

60% work should be done into making data good


## Irrelevent columns

garbage In -> garbage Out  


## overfitting 

when the model too much from the data :: so it's not performing well on data

[you should know the ways to handle overfitting : bcz it's happen too much ]


## Underfitting 


## sofware Intergration

try to make a ML model usable for the user so that they can use it 
integrating the ML model as a software is a complex task in many ways (you'll find out soon)

## offline Learning / Deployement

[process] : converting it into online : real time monitoring in deployement the model is kind of difficult task 
"this area need still a lot of improvement"


## Cost involved 

machine learning server pe optimized nahi hai still
