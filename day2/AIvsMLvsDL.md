# what is intelligence : 
pattern recognition
emotional intelligence 
solving problem
creativity & Imagination



# starting me jab hamne socha tha ki machine me intelligence kaise daal skte hain ya nhi
1) system :  symbolic AI(knowliedge system using if else) : Expert systems (Knowledge base + inference engine ) like chess engine [18's] , 

2) exprt system has problem  : fuzzy logic understanding [like image classification , voice recognition]

3) then comes Machine Learning :

data me jo pattern hai unse learn ka techinques () : 
machine learning me explicit programming nhi kr skte 

rules aapko likhne nhi hain aapko bs data dena pdhega  


# machine learning is not derived from Statistics but it is inspired from it 
it actually more engineering based things not just based on the 


# Deep Learning

what is DL ?
Mathematics based 
inspired from biology but not directly work like how our brain work : 
based on neurons : perceptron(smallest unit)

!! ) agr aap machine learning me hai and let's say aapko dog & cats classify krne hain to aapko define krna pdega unke features ko 

but in deep learning space : features auto detect ho jaate hain

DL : jitna jyada data dete ho utna jyada performance increase hota jaata hai but machine learning models ki accuracy stops at certain point


<!-- AI -> ML -> DL -->
