" if you are not paying for the product then you are the product "

5) Consumer Internet

Twitter: 

2008 starts [ that was not profitable]
they decided to do sentiment analysis on the twitter data " to finalize the revenew process"


Sentiment Analysis : 
how they planned it ?
twitter trend:: BJP vs Mamta Banerji in west bengal "we find the real data"

" if 60% tweets supporting Modi " then there is a great chance that modi wins ::
where will you sell this data :: 

the answer is STOCK BROCKERS : like  Morgan Stanley , JP Morgan 


for example : reliance ka future accha hoga agar modi jeet gaye : to before election ameer logo se paisa leke mai stock khareed lunga :: modi wins:: reliance ka stock actual me badh gya because people started buying stocks :: then i will sell the stocks to earn money from it 



"sentiment analysis is very important"
