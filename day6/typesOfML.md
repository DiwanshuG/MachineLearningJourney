## Instant Based Learning Vs Model Based Learning


learning -> memorizing   or   generalising (conceptual learning)
jo model rtne lag jaata hai usko :  Instance based model 


## instance based learning 

iq | cgpa | placement (y/n)
80 | 7    | n
132| 9    | y
123| 9.3  | n


imagine a plot of data : 

there are also some outlier 
just new data aaya : aapne similarity dekhi and you say according to neighours : nearest 3 point ko pakad lia (for example) : KNN 

jab tk new point nhi aaya tha : tb tk koi learning nhi hui just instantly aapko answer btana hota hai 



## model based learning 

iq | cgpa | placement (y/n)
80 | 7    | n
132| 9    | y
123| 9.3  | n

<!-- model create a decision based function after learning from the data and after training model doesnot need data  -->



instance based learning aka Lazy Learner
