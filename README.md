# MachineLearningJourney

This repository tracks my day-by-day Machine Learning revision journey, combining
theory, mathematical derivations, and hands-on implementation using Jupyter notebooks
and real-world datasets.

Each folder represents a dedicated learning day, where concepts are explored deeply
and implemented from scratch to build strong ML fundamentals.
